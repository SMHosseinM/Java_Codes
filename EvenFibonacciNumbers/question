Each new term in the Finonacci is generated by adding the previous two terms.
By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
		1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 43, 55, 89, ..

By considering the terms in the fibonacci sequece whose values do not exceed 
four million, find the sum of the even valued terms.
