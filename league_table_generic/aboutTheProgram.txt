Create a generic class to implement a league table for a sport.
The class should allow teams to be added to the list, and store
a list of teams that belong to the league

Your class shuld have a method to print out the teams in order,
with the team at the top pf teh league printed first.

Only teams of the same type should be added to any particular 
instance of the league class - th program shuld fail to compile 
if an attempt is made to add an incompatible team.q
